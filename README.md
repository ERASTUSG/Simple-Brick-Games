# Simple-Brick-Games
You can find screenshots for phones [here](./screenshots)

This is litteraly my first Android app and even my first greater project. So please have sympathy that my code style isn't the best. 
I already made some improvements, but I don't want to put too much time in that.

I tried to make it easy to add more subgames in this app.

# Description
This game immitates the good old low cost handhelds

* 14 different mini games
* customizable background, buttons and textures
* highscores for each game
* changeable speed and level for each game


Navigation in main menu, press:
 * left or right to change game
 * up to increase level
 * down to increase speed
 * action button to start game

## Usage
If you want to use my work for your own project (which means in most cases: Put ads in it and publish on Google Play Store) YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE GPL LICENSE! This means, your project MUST be open source under a GPLv3+ compatible license and MUST contain attribution for the original work! I already found a lot of copies which simply removed my "About Game" screen and changed some graphics. If I see your work violating the GPL rules, I will let it get removed by Google. 

So please follow the rules! Use this attribution text (or a similar one)
