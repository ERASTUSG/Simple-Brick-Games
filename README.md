# Simple-Brick-Games
You can find screenshots for phones [here](./screenshots)

This is litteraly my first Android app and even my first greater project. So please have sympathy that my code style isn't the best. 
I already made some improvements, but I don't want to put too much time in that.

I tried to make it easy to add more subgames in this app.
